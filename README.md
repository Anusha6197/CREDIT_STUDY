finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyse the
patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants are capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. The below
challanges to be addressed
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

loss for the company
